# setup-eslint

> CLI Wrapper to clone my eslint setup

Not everything needs to be inside a package, since most of it then needs
to be manually disabled or needs hacks to remove.

It's easier to modify the original eslint config. Hence, this.

## Usage

```sh
npx @barelyhuman/setup-eslint
```

> **Note:** This will override your `.eslintrc` file so make sure you create a backup file if you are running this in an ongoing project
